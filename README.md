# Company Management Tool

## Description
This is a Node.js backend application allows the user to view, add, and remove all departments and employees, as well as update employee roles and who manages them straight from the command line. This app uses MySQL to store all data, and then uses a node package manager called "console.table" to display the data in the command line in neat, easy-to-read tables.
